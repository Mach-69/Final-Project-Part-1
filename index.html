      <h3>The Crocodile of the Lagoon</h3>
      <p>
        Many Filipino children cannot afford good schooling. Most of them are behind other children in countries having similar economies and are challenged in primary learning. For many others, schooling is not at all a part of their reality and this leaves gaps in knowledge and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a reality impacting millions in the country as many children lack the experience of going to the classroom or even learning. The resilient gaps point to a school system yet again leaving behind many students and underlines the need for solutions.

      <h3>A Promise Here, A Promise There</h3>
      <p>
        Programs and projects have been instituted for the children to remain in school and study more effectively. The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program assists families in ensuring the kids continue schooling, while the K–12 curriculum enhances study and prepares students for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of these actions, numerous institutions in the country continue striving to make education more attainable. These initiatives seek to provide youngsters with more opportunities and enable them to reach their full capabilities despite the challenges existing.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">WHERE WE COME IN</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  At L.T., we focus on filling in the small but important gaps that government programs often overlook. While efforts like the 4Ps and the K–12 curriculum have helped many, issues such as corruption, lack of public trust, and poor implementation can hold these programs back. 
  That’s why we create public awareness campaigns, to keep people informed, encourage accountability, and make sure communities know their voices matter. 
  By doing this, we help ensure that the promises made for education and support truly reach the people who need them most.
