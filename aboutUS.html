        <summary>Who is the owner of LT?</summary>
        <p>I am Herald P. Bulaclac, the founder of L.T. I am currently a scholar at the Philippine Science High School, still exploring what I will pursue in college and beyond. My earlier experience as a student journalist in elementary school shaped my skills in communication and advocacy, which now serve as a strong foundation for leading this campaign for quality education.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Why did you make this website?</summary>
        <p>As quality education is our advocacy, our company LT temporarily changed to give public awareness instead of publishing books. With the continuous 
          downfall of literacy rates in the Philippines, we decided that being a publishing company wonâ€™t increase intelligence.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is the background of this "agency"?</summary>
        <p>LT was founded in 1970 in Panabo City, with a mission to spread education in areas of Mindanao. 
          It launched libraries in Lanao del Norte in 1973, and later expanded to Davao City in 2015 with a publishing bookroom and library in Mintal. 
          With its swift success, it changed to online publishing to transport books to various regions of Mindanao. During the pandemic, LT switched plans and made public awareness campaigns thatâ€™s still going today.</p>
